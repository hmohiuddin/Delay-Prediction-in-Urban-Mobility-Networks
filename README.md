# Delay-Prediction-in-Urban-Mobility-Networks

* Creating a delay prediction model utilizing several ML algorithms that can forecast how long a passenger will be delayed when going on a specific journey, route, or line.
* Examine the impact of other external elements such as weather in addition to the parameters included in our data set. We gathered weather data for our time window using the World Weather Online API.
* Analyzing the provided transportation data to extract relevant insights and prepare it for data modeling. The data we used was historical transportation data from GÃ¶ttingen.
* Understanding how accurate delay prediction may assist transportation companies with operational planning and travelers in planning their time ahead.
